 					<h1>Personal Information</h1>
 				</div>

 				<div class="sectionContent">
 					<p>My name is Tom, I was born and raised on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, I attended Sunshine Coast Grammar School and completed grade 12, since then I have completed two years studying a Bachelor of Business and Marketing at USC but deferred and did not take it back up. I had worked in sales at a transport company and ended up starting my own transport business which led me to Melbourne where I lived for 2 years. I missed the ocean to much so moved back to the Sunshine Coast to become a surf coach which I really enjoyed for 3 years. During that time, I met my partner Sarah who is the mother of my two boys and am loving the process of them growing up and creating a happy healthy family. I love the ocean, surfing, spear fishing, diving, any excuse to get salty and be in touch with nature. </p>

 					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
 				</div>

 				<div class="sectionContent">
 					<h3>• What is your interest in IT?
Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>

<p>Information and Technology has always fascinated me, as a child being obsessed with game boys, play stations and dealing with dial up internet, trying to talk to my friends in chatrooms when computers where the size of microwaves. When Myspace first came about, I remember trying to customize my own page by very poorly trying to understand and re write HTML. </p>




<h3>•	When did your interest in IT start?</h3>

<p>I have always been curious by nature, as a kid watching live news reports being delivered on the other side of the world, the delay in audio would always have me thinking; how could this information travel so quickly (at the time) from one place to another and how was it happening? Since then, I have constantly been playing the most current games, getting the most current game consoles and trying to stay up to date with my computers and phone. Technology and IT has always been a massive part of my childhood and my life to date, although I have never truly understood what is going on with the software and how everything operates, I have always wanted to know.</p>

<h3>• Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>

<p>The development and use of technology around the world is increasing, it is an amazing part of our story and an indication of where we as humans are heading. The ability to communicate, solve difficult problems and connect people from around the world is helping solve some of the world’s biggest issues by accelerating the development of education, infrastructure and healthcare globally. The world is going to continue to adopt technology more and more, I have thought I was late to the party but have realised we are still at the very beginning of this journey. I have chosen to study at RMIT because it offers me the flexibility to study online which is important as I still must work and look after my family. The course and its potential outcomes are very exciting and from what I have researched it is one of the best places to study IT within Australia. </p>

<h3>• What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>

<p>I am going into these studies as a blank canvas, I do not really have a goal or a specific thing that I want to learn in mind. The course will cover enough material and areas of IT that while I am completing the course, I will get a better idea of what will captivate me, where it will take me and what I want to get out of it. I have an entrepreneurial mindset and have worked on a few projects over the years, throughout this course I hope to get a better understanding of how certain systems function and will be able to come up with some ideas, apply them to my own personal projects and potentially launch something that will help change people’s lives. </p>

 				<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
 			</div>

 			<div class="sectionContent">
 				<article>
 					<h2>Video Game Software Engineer/Developer</h2>
 					<p>My dream job would be a game software engineer/developer. I have always loved gaming, from playing Donkey Kong on a black and white game boy to Skyrim on Xbox one. The development and progression of games and the software that must go into creating them and ensuring they run smoothly has been something that has always interested me. </p>
          <p>The dream job I have chosen is listed as working at Titanium Studios as a video game software engineer/developer, the most important skills required seem to be related to being highly competent in using C++ or other low-level areas, such as computer hardware architecture and embedded systems, or strong C# skills along with experience in some form of UI layout such as web development, mobile app development, WPF or React.</p>
          <p>Having a Bachelor’s in Engineering, having previous experience in software engineering and proof of previous work all seem favourable when applying and getting the job. As I am only taking my first steps into coding and the world of IT, apart from the experience of playing a lot of games I have very little in the engineering side of things. This is something I hope to develop throughout this course and primarily in the programming subjects. </p>
          <p>The relevant qualifications and experience I hope to gain throughout this course and in my own time. The skills that I already have seem to fit the description quite well. I have good problem-solving skills and always seem to be able to find a solution when faced with an issue.  I am very creative and have done a fair bit of website development for the company I am currently working for, designing and executing various sales promotions. I have excellent time management and communication skills as I have worked in sales, managed and been part of numerous teams throughout my employment history. Staying up to date with industry developments is something that I have always done, whatever I am interested in I am subscribed to, giving me access to upcoming announcements and I am constantly surfing the internet keeping up to date with emerging technologies.</p>
          <p>Throughout this course I aim to learn and anchor myself in my knowledge of software design and programming. Once I have completed this course and improve in the other areas listed, I will be on track to securing my dream job and maybe someday you will be playing a game that I have been a part of!</p>

 				<h1>Personality Profile</h1>
 			</div>

 			<div class="sectionContent">
 				<article>
 					<h2>Campaigner (ENFP-T)</h2>
 					<p>The Campaigner personality type is someone that is extraverted, outgoing, caring, focused when suits and needs to care about a subject when working on it. In a team setting the campaigner will strive to connect and can be a leader, they are comfortable to take control of the work being carried out, they will care about their team members and try to make a connection and form friendships. The downside is when there are some more direct instructions that need to be given or understood. A campaigner can expect a lot out of other team members but will not be willing to give criticism, this can lead to problems with producing the best quality work and functioning well as a team. Also, a campaigner can get bored of a task if it becomes mundane or does not seem crucial or exciting. When forming a team, it is crucial that a campaigner is with a group of people that are open to communication, and they benefit from structure so that they understand what is required of them and do not lose interest.</p>
 					<p>The results of this test are mainly a rough guideline, the biggest problem with it is there are so many questions, and it requires answers to each question on a scale, someone could get a different result if they did the test again.</p>

 					<h2>Test Two</h2>
 					<p class="subDetails">Learning Styles</p>
          <h3>Your Scores:</h3>
          <p>•	Auditory: 25%</p>
          <p>•	Visual: 30%</p>
          <p>•	Tactile: 45%</p>
 					<p>A Tactile learner is someone that is hand on, they like to learn by touching and doing. Being active, fidgeting while studying and taking frequent breaks is the best way to learn. In a team setting a tactile learner will benefit from being shown an example or a process and may struggle being alone and focusing on a single topic for a long period. </p>
          <p>The results of this test are only categorised into three sections which allows a lot of room for error. The questions asked also had similar answers, this would skew the results. If two answers to any given question were true but they had to choose the one that was most suited it would technically put the person taking the quiz into two separate categories, so the results of the test are not entirely accurate.</p>

 					<h2>Test Three</h2>
 					<p class="subDetails">Big 5 Personality Test</p>
          <p><img src="5_Personalities.jpg" alt="5 Personalitis results" /></p>
 					<p>The results of this test suggest that I score high in openness that implies that I tend to think in abstract and complex ways. Also, I score high in extraversion that means I seek stimulation from the outside world and seek the attention of others. These traits are beneficial in a team setting as I am creative open and keen to reach out and engage with my teammates.</p>

 				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
        <h1>HELPER - Application/Website</h1>
 			</div>

 			<div class="sectionContent">
 				<article>
 					<h2>Overview</h2>
 					<p>Helper is an application that is designed to give people easy access to the relevant information when making a purchase. In the past when people would enquire about goods or services they would rely on things like the yellow pages or word of mouth. These methods would often have limited results and may result in people not getting the best deal and spending more money on a worse product or service. With the invention of the internet and search engines it has become easier to search and compare the best deals and get the best value for money. Businesses have started investing a lot of money into advertising online and sometimes when searching for a product or service people can get lost in pages of paid ads instead of quickly finding out how much something costs and what is of best value. To solve this problem developing an application that compares goods and services and breaks down the results into three categories, cheapest, best, and DIY. This application is called Helper.</p>
 				</article>

 				<article>
 					<h2>Motivation</h2>
 					<p>‘81% of retail shoppers conduct online research before buying. The overwhelming majority of retail consumers start their journey with online research (Source: GE Capital Retail Bank).’ The majority of these shoppers will use search engines to compare products and services. ‘59% of shoppers use their mobile devices in-store to compare costs or research deals and coupons. (Source: HRC Retail Advisory).’ Technology has become so available and easy to use that people are spending more time researching for better deals and how to save money where they can. The growing trend in how to and DIY videos is allowing people to complete work themselves that they would have previously had to pay someone for. The data suggests that most people do their own research on products before they purchase, when researching they will tend to compare price, value and if they can do it themselves. Creating an application to make this process easier will be beneficial to the user and fill a gap in the market.</p>
 				</article>

 				<article>
 					<h2>Description</h2>
 					<p>The application would allow the user to input a problem, for example “need a new bike tyre” and would be presented with three different options, these options will provide the user with an indication of price range, what is best value and also a third option of any available DIY material on the specific problem.</p>
          <h3>Cheapest</h3>
          <p>This option would be the cheapest way to fix the problem, it would have a links to the available products or services that would apply. This option may not be the best value for money as the product or service that is the cheapest may be inferior, it will however give the user an idea of the absolute minimum cost necessary to solve the problem</p>
          <h3>Best</h3>
          <p>This option does not necessarily have to be the most expensive option available but the best value for money spent. This category will include relevant information on the product or service. This will be the hardest function of the application as it is not just based on price, depending on the goods or service provided a lot of market research will be necessary to understand what is required in specific industries.</p>
          <h3>DIY</h3>
          <p>DIY and how to videos are growing exponentially, this stems from the high demand for content and people searching for information available online. Apart from highly specialised work that requires licenses, average people looking to save some money are researching and completing anything from mechanical work, painting, landscaping to boat building. If this trend continues there will be how to videos on anything you could imagine as content creators continue to grow.</p>
          <p>As it becomes easier to access relevant information using search engines, people are going to start doing more research before purchasing. The application will be designed to make this process even easier and navigate through the massive amount of paid advertising that tends to mislead or re direct people. Having the basic three categories will give the user a good indication of price range, value and an option on how to do it themselves.</p>
          <p>With services such as health insurance and other things that cannot be done by the person it will just be an indication of price range and in the DIY section it will include a description of what that service should include. The goods and services that do not have a DIY option will still give value to the user as it will provide useful information that will help them make a more informed decision when purchasing.</p>
          <p>Market comparison businesses are not new, there are many well established companies that compare pricing in various industries’ free of charge. These companies will generally get users details through their website or applications, they will then sell the users details as leads to multiple different businesses, who will then contact the customers with pricing and quotes. The difference with Helper will be that you will not have to input details and then be bombarded with 20 phone calls and emails from different companies, it will be a simple to use application that will provide information to the user for them to make a decision and get more value out of their purchase.</p>
      	</article>

 					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
 					<p>Helper will be both a website and application, this is important as it will be able to reach more people and be used quickly and easily. Having the application accessible on both android and iOS is crucial to give access to the most people. A web crawler will be necessary to get the most information in real-time on the things listed on Helper, although there will a large input by the developer so that the user will get relevant information and to ensure it is accurate. Anybody that wants information on a particular product or service, with access to the internet via a phone, computer or laptop will be able to access Helper.</p>
 				</article>

 				<article>
 					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
 					<p>To create the website version of Helper a solid understanding of HTML, CSS and Java script will be required. The website needs to be easy to navigate and user friendly while maintaining very good aesthetics so visual design will be important. The application will need to operate on both iOs and android devices so the ability to code and programming using C++ is required. To build the web crawler capable of collecting the right data, learning how to code using python and researching the correct process will be necessary. Having access to the right computers and building a team with the right people to help start this project.</p>
 				</article>

 				<article>
 					<h2>Outcome</h2>
 					<p>If the project is successful, it will be a valuable tool that everyone will use when they are about to make a purchase, it will give consumers more confidence when making purchases knowing they are getting a good deal or realising they can do it themselves. Streamlining the decision-making process will save people time and money and will help solve the issue of navigating the increasingly annoying world of paid advertisement. With online shopping and purchases increasing every year, Helper will help people find a solution to the problems they have, will do the market research for them and make purchasing less stressful.</p>
